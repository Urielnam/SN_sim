# ISR_SIM
# This repository is a simulation for my ISR SoS article.
# currently there is a single simulation with working UI.
# The current goal is to have a main file that runs the single simulation multiple times and then presents the total run.
# future - adding controls over this simulation (have the agents know that there is low or high self organization).
